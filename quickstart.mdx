Get your app connected to CoreBase in just a few steps.

## 1. Installation

Install the CoreBase client library.

```bash
npm install corebase-js
```

If you use React or React Native, you'll want the React hooks too:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react @types/react
```

## 2. Initialization

Connect to your project using your API Key. You can find these details in your CoreBase dashboard.

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'corebase-js';

const CLIENT_URL = 'https://corebase.trivyaa.in'; // Your API URL
const API_KEY = 'pk_...'; // Your Public API Key

const corebase = createClient(CLIENT_URL, API_KEY);
```
