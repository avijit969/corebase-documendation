<Note>
  Most users should use the **CoreBase JS Client** instead of calling the API directly. 
  The client handles authentication, real-time updates, and type safety for you.

## Overview

CoreBase provides a full RESTful API for interacting with your database, authentication, and storage. 
You can use this API if you are building a client in a language that doesn't have an official CoreBase SDK, or if you prefer making raw HTTP requests.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to your project's endpoint:

```bash
https://<project-ref>.corebase.trivyaa.in/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Identify your requests by including your API Key in the `apikey` header.

```bash
apikey: <your-public-api-key>
Authorization: Bearer <your-session-token>
```
